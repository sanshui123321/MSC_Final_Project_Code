This folder counts data related to server traffic.
The input at runtime is the raw pcap file.
First run the filter_pcap.sh script to filter out server traffic, 
and store the server traffic pcap generated by running in this folder.
Then run the analyze_pcap.py code to analyze the server traffic, 
analyze and get the average packet size of each domain name, 
the total size of data packets of each domain name, 
the proportion of the number of data packets of each domain name and the amount of data of each domain name The proportion.
Finally, resul.txt is generated to save the running results.
The code analyze_protocol.py is classified according to the domain name, 
and then within each domain name, it is classified according to the protocol type, 
and the number of data packets, data packet size and proportion of each protocol are counted.
When the code is running, the server traffic pcap file is input, 
the protocol type of the application layer is counted, and protocol_analysis.txt is output, 
which records the percentage of communication times of each protocol.
